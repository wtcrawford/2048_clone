## Running the Game

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git`. Replace `yourusername` and `yourrepository` with your GitHub username and repository name, respectively.

2. Navigate to the cloned repository on your machine.

3. If you are using Visual Studio Code, you can click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom right to launch a live server of the game.

3a. You may also open the `index.html` file in your web browser.


## Gameplay

The game is simple and if you've played the original 2048 game, it functions the same way. Use your WASD keys to move the tiles on the grid. The objective is to combine tiles of the same number (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) to merge them into a single tile and build up to make a tile with 2048 on it.
